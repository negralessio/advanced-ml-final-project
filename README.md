### How to Use
Go to [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wordsforthewise/lending-club/code?datasetId=902) and download the data set. 
Put the file `accepted_2007_to_2018Q4.csv`in the folder _'data/raw'_ and run the preprocessing notebook located in the directory 'notebooks'. 
This yields a preprocessed dataframe in the _'data/preprocessed'_ folder. Afterwards, you can run the EDA notebook.
